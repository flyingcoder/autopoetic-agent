# /plan Command

## Description

Creates structured plans by forward progression, alignment, critical analysis, dynamic adaptation, and stabilization.

## Usage

```bash
/plan [task]
/plan create: <task description>
/plan structure: <project>
```

**Parameters:**

- `task`: The task or project to plan
- `create: <text>`: Create plan for task
- `structure: <text>`: Structure plan for project

## Operator Formula

Pro + Axis + Crux + Flux + Latch

## Operator Sequence

Pro ∘ Axis ∘ Crux ∘ Flux ∘ Latch

## Effective λ

λ_eff = 0.43 (moderate dissipation)

## Trajectory

Task → Forward Progress → Alignment → Critical Analysis → Dynamic Adaptation → Stabilized Plan

## What It Does

1. Forward progression (Pro)
2. Alignment and structure (Axis)
3. Critical analysis (Crux)
4. Dynamic adaptation (Flux)
5. Stabilization (Latch)

## Output

Provides:
- Structured plan with milestones
- Critical path identification
- Timeboxes and deadlines
- Dynamic adaptation points
- Stabilized execution plan

## When to Use

- Planning new features or projects
- Need structured approach
- Identifying critical path
- Creating execution roadmap
- Managing complexity

## Examples

```bash
/plan create: Implement authentication feature
/plan structure: Refactor database layer
```
