# /reverse-engineer Command - Reverse Engineering Assistant

## Description

Reverse engineers systems, code, and architectures to understand structure and behavior. Uses controlled rupture operators to systematically deconstruct and understand.

## Usage

```bash
/reverse-engineer <target>
/reverse-engineer code: <file-path>
/reverse-engineer system: <description>
```

**Parameters:**

- `code: <path>`: Reverse engineer code
- `system: <description>`: Reverse engineer system

## What It Does

Applies controlled rupture operators:
- **Retro** (↶): Work backward from behavior
- **Ana** (↑): Abstract to understand structure
- **Weave** (🕸️): Integrate understanding
- **Meta** (⟲): Reflect on architecture

## Examples

```bash
/reverse-engineer code: legacy_api.py
/reverse-engineer system: Microservices architecture
```

## Output

Provides:
- System understanding
- Architecture diagrams
- Code structure analysis
- Behavior documentation
- Dependency mapping

## When to Use

- Understanding legacy code
- Documenting systems
- Learning architectures
- Migration planning
