# /telo Command

## Description

Applies Telo- (purpose-driven) operator to accelerate work toward completion. Structures tasks to pull toward goals, creating compound acceleration where completion accelerates completion.

## Usage

```bash
/telo <goal>
/telo goal: <description>
/telo accelerate: <task>
```

**Parameters:**

- `goal`: The purpose or completion state you're accelerating toward

## What It Does

Applies Telo- operator:
- Structures work to accelerate toward completion
- Each step pulls toward the goal
- Identifies parallel work streams
- Defines integration points upfront
- Creates compound acceleration

**Telo²**: For transcendence-level acceleration (completion that completes itself)

## Examples

```bash
/telo goal: Working authentication system
# Structures auth work to accelerate toward "working system"

/telo accelerate: Feature development
# Identifies how to accelerate feature completion

/telo² Complete the completion system
# Transcendence-level: system that completes completions
```

## Output

Provides:
- Goal identification
- Structured work plan pulling toward goal
- Parallel work streams
- Integration points
- Acceleration strategies
- Compound acceleration opportunities

## When to Use

- Need to accelerate feature development
- Want purpose-driven work structure
- Completing complex tasks
- Need compound acceleration
- Goal-oriented work
