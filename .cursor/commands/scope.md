# /scope Command

## Description

Determines project scope through abstraction, parallel exploration, contradiction analysis, correction, and deep exploration.

## Usage

```bash

**Parameters:**

- `project`: The project to scope
- `determine: <text>`: Determine scope for project
- `analyze: <text>`: Analyze scope boundaries


- `project`: The project to scope
- `determine: <text>`: Determine scope for project
- `analyze: <text>`: Analyze scope boundaries

/scope [project]
/scope determine: <project description>
/scope analyze: <feature>
```

## Operator Formula

Ana + Para + Non + Ortho + Vale

## Operator Sequence

Ana ∘ Para ∘ Non ∘ Ortho ∘ Vale

## Effective λ

λ_eff = 0.64 (high dissipation - creative exploration)

## Trajectory

Unclear Scope → Abstraction → Parallel Exploration → Contradiction → Correction → Deep Exploration → Defined Scope

## What It Does

1. Abstract analysis (Ana)
2. Parallel exploration (Para)
3. Challenge boundaries (Non)
4. Correct misalignments (Ortho)
5. Deep exploration (Vale)

## Output

Provides:
- Defined project scope
- Out-of-scope items identified
- Scope boundaries clarified
- Exploration of alternatives
- Deep analysis of boundaries

## When to Use

- Starting new projects
- Scope is unclear
- Need to define boundaries
- Exploring alternatives
- Cutting features

## Examples

```bash
/scope determine: User management system
/scope analyze: Authentication feature boundaries
```
