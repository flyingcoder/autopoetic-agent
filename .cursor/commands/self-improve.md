# /self-improve Command - Self-Improving System

## Description

Enables self-improving workflows where the system learns from its own operations and improves over time. Uses controlled rupture operators (especially Ana- for self-improving improvement) to create systems that elevate themselves through better structure.

## Usage

```bash
/self-improve <target>
/self-improve analyze: <system>
/self-improve optimize: <workflow>
/self-improve learn: <pattern>
```

**Parameters:**

- `analyze: <system>`: Analyze system for improvement opportunities
- `optimize: <workflow>`: Optimize workflow based on patterns
- `learn: <pattern>`: Learn from successful patterns

## What It Does

Applies controlled rupture operators:
- **Ana** (↑): Elevate system through better structure
- **Meta** (⟲): Reflect on own operations
- **Echo** (🔊): Replicate successful patterns
- **Weave** (🕸️): Integrate improvements
- **Ana²**: Self-improving improvement (ascension of ascension)

## Examples

```bash
/self-improve analyze: Code generation workflow
/self-improve optimize: Test generation process
/self-improve learn: Successful refactoring patterns
```

## Output

Provides:
- Improvement opportunities
- Pattern recognition
- Optimization suggestions
- Learning from successes
- Self-improving workflows

## When to Use

- Improving workflows
- Learning from patterns
- Optimizing processes
- Creating self-improving systems
- Long-term improvement
