# /detect-state Command

## Description

Detects the current phase space state (J=0, S*, or ∅) by analyzing problem characteristics, contradictions, and system dynamics.

## Usage

```bash
/detect-state [problem]
/detect-state analyze: <description>
/detect-state check: <context>
```

## Operator Formula

Multi-signal analysis: Non ∘ Meta ∘ Crux (contradiction), Kata ∘ Ortho ∘ Latch (coherence), Ana ∘ Para ∘ Flux (tension)

## Operator Sequence

Meta ∘ Flux ∘ Pro ∘ Crux

## Effective λ

λ_eff = 0.54 (moderate dissipation)

## Trajectory

Input → Analysis → State Detection → Attractor Prediction → Recommendation

## What It Does

1. Analyzes problem characteristics
2. Detects phase space state
3. Predicts attractor
4. Recommends sequences

## Examples

```bash
/detect-state Fix login bug
/detect-state analyze: Need both performance and simplicity but they conflict
```
