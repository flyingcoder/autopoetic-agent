# /ana Command

## Description

Applies Ana- (upward/throughout) operator to elevate systems through structure. Enables self-improvement where each improvement enables further improvement.

## Usage

```bash
/ana <target>
/ana elevate: <system>
/ana improve: <code-path>
/ana² <target>
```

**Parameters:**

- `target`: The system, code, or structure to elevate

## What It Does

Applies Ana- operator:
- Elevates through better structure
- System improves itself
- Each improvement enables further improvement
- Creates self-improving patterns

**Ana²**: For ascension of ascension (self-improving improvement)

## Examples

```bash
/ana elevate: Authentication system
# Suggests structural improvements that enable further improvements

/ana improve: src/utils/validation.ts
# Elevates validation code through better structure

/ana² Code quality system
# Creates system that improves its own improvement mechanisms
```

## Output

Provides:
- Structural elevation suggestions
- Self-improving patterns
- Improvement cascades
- Systems that improve themselves
- Ascension strategies

## When to Use

- Improving code quality
- Refactoring for better structure
- Creating self-improving systems
- Elevating architecture
- Long-term improvement
