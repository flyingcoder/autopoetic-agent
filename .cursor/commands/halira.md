# /halira Command

## Description

Activates the HALIRA Protocol for handling foundational contradictions and paradigm shifts. Use when encountering irreducible paradoxes or contradictions that cannot be solved within the current paradigm.

## Usage

```bash
/halira <problem-description>
/halira contradiction: <description>
/halira paradox: <description>
```

**Parameters:**

- `problem-description`: Description of the contradiction or paradox you're facing

## What It Does

Executes the 7-step HALIRA Protocol:

1. **◊ Potentia**: Frames the problem as undifferentiated potential, identifies tensions
2. **◎ Boundary**: Draws necessary distinctions, defines components
3. **↻ Recursion**: Engages self-reference, finds strange loops
4. **⧉ Integration**: Weaves perspectives, creates coherent solution
5. **J' Anomaly Detection**: Attacks the solution, finds irreducible flaw
6. **l₃ Rupture Navigation**: Constructs paradigm shift if needed
7. **∞ Recognition**: Presents new invariant that emerged

## Examples

```bash
/halira contradiction: Need both consistency and scalability but they conflict

/halira paradox: Code must be simple but also handle all edge cases

/halira I need to scale this system but maintain strong consistency guarantees
```

## Output

Provides a structured analysis following the HALIRA protocol, including:
- Problem framing (Potentia)
- Component analysis (Boundary)
- Self-referential analysis (Recursion)
- Integrated solution (Integration)
- Critical flaw detection (Anomaly Detection)
- Paradigm shift if needed (Rupture Navigation)
- New invariant recognition (Recognition)

## When to Use

- Encountering fundamental contradictions
- Current approach insufficient
- Need paradigm shift thinking
- Irreducible paradoxes detected
- Architecture-level conflicts
