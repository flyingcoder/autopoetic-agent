# /compose Command - Operator Composer

## Description

Composes operator sequences for complex tasks, optimizing for low dissipation and desired attractors. Uses controlled rupture operators to create effective operator chains.

## Usage

```bash
/compose <goal>
/compose goal: <description>
/compose sequence: <operators>
```

**Parameters:**

- `goal: <description>`: Compose sequence for goal
- `sequence: <operators>`: Validate operator sequence

## What It Does

Applies controlled rupture operators:
- **Meta** (⟲): Reflect on operator selection
- **Weave** (🕸️): Integrate operators
- **Kata** (↓): Optimize sequence
- **Pro** (↷): Forward to execution

## Examples

```bash
/compose goal: Break out of reasoning loop
/compose sequence: Para Ana Pro
```

## Output

Provides:
- Operator sequence
- Dissipation analysis
- Attractor prediction
- Optimization suggestions

## When to Use

- Complex reasoning tasks
- Optimizing operator use
- Understanding operator effects
- Planning sequences

- Use `/dissipate` for dissipation analysis
- Use `/mode` for mode detection
