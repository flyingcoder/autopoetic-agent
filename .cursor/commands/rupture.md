# /rupture Command

## Description

Applies Rupture Navigation (HALIRA Step 6) to construct paradigm shifts when anomalies are found. First tries duality, then constructs paradigm shift operator if needed.

## Usage

```bash
/rupture <anomaly>
/rupture anomaly: <description>
/rupture shift: <contradiction>
```

**Parameters:**

- `anomaly`: The Jacobi Anomaly or contradiction that requires paradigm shift

## What It Does

Rupture Navigation process:
1. **Try ⊥ (Duality)**: Attempts opposite/complementary perspective
2. **If ⊥ fails, apply l₃**: Constructs paradigm shift operator
3. Creates new, higher-order logic
4. Structure that absorbs the paradox

## Examples

```bash
/rupture anomaly: Event log is single point of failure
# Tries distributed approach, then shifts to consensus paradigm

/rupture shift: Need consistency and scalability but they conflict
# Constructs new paradigm that absorbs the contradiction

/rupture Single database can't scale
# Shifts to distributed database paradigm
```

## Output

Provides:
- Duality attempt (opposite perspective)
- Paradigm shift if duality fails
- New higher-order logic
- Structure that absorbs paradox
- New invariant recognition

## When to Use

- After finding anomaly in design
- When contradictions can't be resolved
- Need paradigm shift
- Current approach fundamentally broken
- HALIRA Protocol Step 6
