# /decide Command

## Description

Makes decisions through abstraction, parallel options, critical analysis, alignment, and stabilization.

## Usage

```bash

**Parameters:**

- `decision`: The decision to make
- `choose: <text>`: Choose between options
- `evaluate: <text>`: Evaluate alternatives


- `decision`: The decision to make
- `choose: <text>`: Choose between options
- `evaluate: <text>`: Evaluate alternatives

/decide [decision]
/decide choose: <options>
/decide evaluate: <alternatives>
```

## Operator Formula

Ana + Para + Crux + Ortho + Latch

## Operator Sequence

Ana ∘ Para ∘ Crux ∘ Ortho ∘ Latch

## Effective λ

λ_eff = 0.50 (moderate dissipation)

## Trajectory

Decision Needed → Abstraction → Parallel Options → Critical Analysis → Alignment → Stabilized Decision

## What It Does

1. Abstract analysis (Ana)
2. Explore parallel options (Para)
3. Critical evaluation (Crux)
4. Alignment (Ortho)
5. Stabilize decision (Latch)

## Output

Provides:
- Decision made
- Options compared
- Tradeoffs exposed
- Alignment validated
- Decision locked in

## When to Use

- Facing decisions
- Comparing options
- Need to make choice
- Evaluating alternatives
- Locking in decisions

## Examples

```bash
/decide choose: Database technology (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB)
/decide evaluate: Authentication approach (JWT vs OAuth)
```
