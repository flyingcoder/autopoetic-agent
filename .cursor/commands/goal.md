# /goal Command

## Description

Defines and clarifies project goals using purpose-driven compression, contradiction analysis, and critical decision points.

## Usage

```bash
/goal [description]
/goal define: <goal description>
/goal clarify: <unclear goal>
```

**Parameters:**

- `description`: The goal to define or clarify
- `define: <text>`: Explicitly define a new goal
- `clarify: <text>`: Clarify an unclear or ambiguous goal

## Operator Formula

Telo + Kata + Non + Crux

## Operator Sequence

Telo ∘ Kata ∘ Non ∘ Crux

## Effective λ

λ_eff = 0.48 (moderate dissipation)

## Trajectory

Unclear Goal → Purpose-Driven Direction → Concrete Formulation → Contradiction Challenge → Critical Decision → Clear Goal

## What It Does

1. Establishes purpose (Telo)
2. Compresses to concrete form (Kata)
3. Challenges assumptions (Non)
4. Identifies critical points (Crux)

## Examples

```bash
/goal define: Build user authentication system
/goal clarify: Improve performance while maintaining simplicity
```

## Output

Provides:
- Clear goal statement
- Non-goals (what's explicitly excluded)
- Measurable success criteria
- Critical decision points
- Contradictions and tradeoffs identified

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or feature
- Goals are unclear or ambiguous
- Need to align team on objectives
- Defining success criteria
- Identifying critical decisions
