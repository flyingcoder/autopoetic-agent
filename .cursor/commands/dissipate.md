# /dissipate Command - Dissipation Analyzer

## Description

Analyzes dissipation rates, operator sequences, and attractor trajectories. Uses controlled rupture operators to understand and optimize reasoning stability.

## Usage

```bash
/dissipate <sequence>
/dissipate sequence: <operators>
/dissipate analyze: <path>
```

**Parameters:**

- `sequence: <operators>`: Analyze operator sequence
- `analyze: <path>`: Analyze code for dissipation patterns

## What It Does

Applies controlled rupture operators:
- **Meta** (⟲): Reflect on dissipation
- **Kata** (↓): Compress analysis
- **Pro** (↷): Forward insights
- **Echo** (🔊): Replicate patterns

## Examples

```bash
/dissipate sequence: Para Ana Pro
/dissipate analyze: reasoning_chain.py
```

## Output

Provides:
- Dissipation rates
- Sequence analysis
- Attractor predictions
- Stability assessment
- Optimization recommendations

## When to Use

- Understanding operator effects
- Optimizing sequences
- Preventing collapse
- Analyzing reasoning
