    🌐 **Web Development MCP Essentials:**
    
    **Three Essential MCP Servers for Web Development:**
    
    1. **Linear MCP Server** ⭐⭐⭐
       - Project management integration
       - Issue tracking and task management
       - Configuration: stdio via npx
       - Use: "list all issues related to this project"
       - Reference: https://cursor.com/docs/cookbook/web-development
    
    2. **Figma MCP Server** ⭐⭐⭐
       - Design system and mockup access
       - Component specifications
       - Configuration: SSE transport (http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse)
       - Use: Access designs of current selection in Figma
       - Reference: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server
    
    3. **Browser Tools MCP Server** ⭐⭐⭐
       - Console logs and network requests
       - Implementation verification
       - Configuration: Follow installation at browsertools.agentdesk.ai
       - Use: Monitor console output and network activity
       - Reference: https://cursor.com/docs/cookbook/web-development
    
    **Setup Priority:**
    - Start with these three for web development
    - They enable tight feedback loops
    - Reduce context switching significantly

rule "Component Reuse with MCP" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: block.text contains "component" and (block.text contains "reuse" or block.text contains "design system")
  message: |
    🧩 **Component Reuse with MCP:**
    
    **Design System Integration:**
    - Use Figma MCP to access component specifications
    - Reference existing UI components from your component library
    - Create new components by orchestrating existing UI components
    - Ask human when components or designs are missing
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Reuse existing UI components from `/src/components/ui` (or your component path)
    - These are the primitives you can build with
    - Only create new components when existing ones don't solve the problem
    - Maintain consistency with design system via Figma MCP
    
    **Workflow:**
    1. Check Figma MCP for design specs
    2. Look for existing components in codebase
    3. Reuse or compose existing components
    4. Create new only if necessary
    5. Verify in browser using Browser Tools MCP

rule "Tight Feedback Loops" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: block.text contains "feedback" or block.text contains "iteration" or block.text contains "verification"
  message: |
    🔄 **Tight Feedback Loops in Web Development:**
    
    **MCP-Enabled Workflow:**
    1. **Linear MCP**: Pull task/issue requirements
    2. **Figma MCP**: Access design specifications
    3. **Implementation**: Build using component library
    4. **Browser Tools MCP**: Verify implementation matches design
    5. **Iterate**: Quick adjustments based on browser feedback
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Fast iterations without context switching
    - Direct access to designs and requirements
    - Real-time verification of implementations
    - Maintains flow state
    
    **Tools Integration:**
    - Chat for bootstrapping changes
    - Inline Edit and Tab for maintaining flow
    - MCP servers for external tool access
    - Browser Tools for verification

rule "Project Management Integration" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: block.text contains "Linear" or block.text contains "project management" or block.text contains "issue"
  message: |
    📋 **Project Management with Linear MCP:**
    
    **Linear MCP Server:**
    - Read and manage issues directly in Cursor
    - List issues related to current project
    - Access task details and requirements
    - Update issue status
    
    **Configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Linear": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Setup:**
    1. Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)
    2. Enable from MCP settings (Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol)
    3. Authorize with Linear (browser opens)
    4. Use: "list all issues related to this project"
    
    **Benefits:**
    - No context switching to Linear app
    - Direct access to requirements
    - Task tracking within Cursor
}

rule "Design System Access" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: block.text contains "Figma" or block.text contains "design" or block.text contains "mockup"
