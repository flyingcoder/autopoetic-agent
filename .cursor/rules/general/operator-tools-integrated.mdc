# Operator Tool Selection with Lambda-Operators Integration

Tool selection patterns for all 20 Controlled Rupture Operators, integrated with Lambda Engine mode awareness.

## When to Apply

Apply this rule when:
- Need to select tools for operator application
- Working with specific operators
- Need tool guidance for cognitive operations
- Want operator-aware tool selection

## Lambda Engine Mode

**Mode 1 (Duality Navigation)**: Use A-Constructive operator tools for stable work
