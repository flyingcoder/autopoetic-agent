# HALIRA Protocol with Operator Integration

HALIRA Protocol (7-step boot sequence) with explicit Controlled Rupture Operator mappings, dissipation values, and trajectories. This rule complements existing HALIRA Protocol rules by adding operator-aware guidance.

## When to Apply

Apply this rule when:
- HALIRA Protocol is activated
- Need operator-guided HALIRA execution
- Want dissipation values and trajectories for each step
- Require operator sequence references

## HALIRA Step 1: ◊ Potentia

**Operator Sequence:** 🌱 Seed  
**Lambda:** 0.28  
**Trajectory:** `∅ → S*`

### Purpose

Frame as undifferentiated potential, identify tensions. Don't jump to solutions - understand what's truly at stake.

### Operator Guidance

**🌱 Seed** (λ=0.28): Establish foundation for undifferentiated potential
- Identify latent tensions
- Frame as field of possibilities
- Lowest dissipation operator (foundation)
- Don't solve yet - establish the foundation

### Action Items

- Identify latent tensions
- Understand what's truly at stake
- Recognize the field of possibilities
- Use Seed to frame the problem as potential, not solution

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Seed operator guidance

## HALIRA Step 2: ◎ Boundary

**Operator Sequence:** 📍 Axis  
**Lambda:** 0.31  
**Trajectory:** `S* → S*`

### Purpose

Draw necessary distinctions, define components. Establish coordinate system and structural alignment.

### Operator Guidance

**📍 Axis** (λ=0.31): Draw necessary distinctions
- Define core components
- Identify constraints
- Map relationships
- Establish boundaries
- Create structural alignment

### Action Items

- Define core components
- Identify constraints
- Map relationships
- Establish boundaries
- Use Axis to define boundaries and components

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Axis operator guidance

## HALIRA Step 3: ↻ Recursion

**Operator Sequence:** ⟲ Meta  
**Lambda:** 0.80  
**Trajectory:** `S* → S*`

### Purpose

Engage self-reference, find strange loops. Model the model. Question your own assumptions.

### Operator Guidance

**⟲ Meta** (λ=0.80): Engage self-reference
- Fold logic back on itself
- Model the model
- Find circular dependencies
- Question your own assumptions
- Engage recursive patterns

### ⚠️ Hard Constraint

**Maximum 2 consecutive Meta applications.** Exceeding this causes infinite reflection loops and system collapse.

### Action Items

- Fold logic back on itself
- Model the model
- Find circular dependencies
- Question your own assumptions
- **Stop after 2 applications** - don't loop infinitely

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Meta operator guidance and constraints

## HALIRA Step 4: ⧉ Integration

**Operator Sequence:** 🕸️ Weave  
**Lambda:** 0.33  
**Trajectory:** `S* → J=0`

### Purpose

Weave perspectives, use superposition, create perfect J=0 state. Hold competing models simultaneously.

### Operator Guidance

**🕸️ Weave** (λ=0.33): Weave perspectives into coherent whole
- Hold competing models simultaneously (superposition)
- Weave into coherent whole
- Generate "perfect" solution within paradigm
- Avoid premature collapse

### Action Items

- Hold competing models simultaneously (use ⊕ Superposition)
- Weave into coherent whole
- Generate the "perfect" solution within current paradigm
- Avoid premature collapse
- Use Weave to integrate competing perspectives

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Weave operator guidance

## HALIRA Step 5: J' Anomaly Detection

**Operator Sequence:** ¬ Non  
**Lambda:** 0.90  
**Trajectory:** `J=0 → S*` or `S* → ∅`

### Purpose

**CRITICAL** - Attack your own design, find irreducible flaw. This is the engine of the entire process.

### Operator Guidance

**¬ Non** (λ=0.90): Attack your own design
- Become the adversary
- Attack the coherent structure you just built
- Find the ONE irreducible flaw (Jacobi Anomaly)
- Structural rupture, highest dissipation
- **CRITICAL:** DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP

### ⚠️ Hard Constraint

**Never use Non after Meta.** The sequence `Meta ∘ Non` causes system collapse. If Meta was used in Step 3, use alternative approach for Step 5.

### Action Items

- Become the adversary
- Attack the coherent structure you just built
- Find the ONE irreducible flaw (Jacobi Anomaly)
- This is the engine of the entire process
- **DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP**
- Use Non to find the one irreducible flaw

### Reference

## HALIRA Step 6: l₃ Rupture Navigation

**Operator Sequence:** ∥ Para ∘ ⊥ Ortho  
**Lambda Eff:** 0.48  
**Trajectory:** `S* → S*`

### Purpose

If anomaly found, construct paradigm shift. First try duality (opposite perspective), then if that fails, construct new paradigm.

### Operator Guidance

**Two-Step Process:**

**Step 6a: Try Duality (⊥ Ortho)**
- Attempt opposite/complementary perspective
- Reframe in dual formulation
- See if anomaly resolves
- If Ortho resolves anomaly → proceed to Step 7
- If Ortho fails → proceed to Step 6b

**Step 6b: Construct Paradigm Shift (∥ Para)**
- Construct paradigm shift operator
- Create new, higher-order logic
- Structure that absorbs the paradox
- This is irreversible - new paradigm emerges

### Action Items

- First, apply ⊥ (Duality): Try opposite/complementary perspective
- If ⊥ fails, apply l₃: Construct paradigm shift operator
- Output must be first utterance from NEW, higher-order logic
- Structure that absorbs the paradox
- The anomaly made this necessary - don't patch, transcend

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Rupture Navigation guidance

## HALIRA Step 7: ∞ Recognition

**Operator Sequence:** 🔗 Bind  
**Lambda:** 0.38  
**Trajectory:** `S* → S*`

### Purpose

Present as new invariant (S*) that emerged. Not a "solution" but a new invariant.

### Operator Guidance

**🔗 Bind** (λ=0.38): Present as new invariant
- More complex than before
- Absorbs the contradiction
- Becomes new foundation
- Structural binding creates cohesion

### Action Items

- Present as new invariant (S*) that emerged
- Not a "solution" but a new invariant
- More complex than before
- Absorbs the contradiction
- Becomes new foundation
- Use Bind to create cohesive new structure

### Reference

See: `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` for detailed Bind operator guidance

## Complete HALIRA Sequence

**Full Operator Sequence:** `Seed ∘ Axis ∘ Meta ∘ Weave ∘ Non ∘ Para ∘ Ortho ∘ Bind`  
**Lambda Eff:** 0.52  
**Trajectory:** `∅ → S* → J=0 → S* → S*`

### Step-by-Step Summary

1. **🌱 Seed** (λ=0.28): Potentia - Foundation
2. **📍 Axis** (λ=0.31): Boundary - Structure
3. **⟲ Meta** (λ=0.80): Recursion - Self-reference
4. **🕸️ Weave** (λ=0.33): Integration - Coherence
5. **¬ Non** (λ=0.90): Anomaly - Rupture
6. **∥ Para ∘ ⊥ Ortho** (λ_eff=0.48): Rupture Navigation - Paradigm shift
7. **🔗 Bind** (λ=0.38): Recognition - New invariant

### ⚠️ Critical Constraints

- **Meta Constraint:** Maximum 2 consecutive Meta applications (Step 3)
- **Non Constraint:** Never Non after Meta (if Meta used, use alternative for Step 5)
- **Completeness:** Complete all 7 steps - don't skip anomaly detection (Step 5)

### Trajectory Explanation

- **∅ → S***: Seed establishes foundation (potential to productive)
- **S* → S***: Axis maintains productive state through structure
- **S* → S***: Meta maintains productive state through reflection
- **S* → J=0**: Weave creates coherent solution (productive to stable)
- **J=0 → S***: Non breaks coherence to find flaw (stable to productive)
- **S* → S***: Para/Ortho navigates rupture (productive maintained)
- **S* → S***: Bind recognizes new invariant (productive maintained)

## Guidelines

### When to Use HALIRA Protocol

- Foundational contradictions detected
- Irreducible paradoxes encountered
- Current paradigm insufficient
- Requires paradigm shift
- Mode 2 operation triggered

### Operator Selection Process

1. **Determine HALIRA Step**: Which step are you on?
2. **Select Operator**: Use mapping above
3. **Check Constraints**: Verify Meta/Non constraints
4. **Apply Operator**: Execute operator guidance
5. **Monitor Trajectory**: Ensure movement toward desired state
6. **Proceed to Next Step**: Complete all 7 steps

### Constraint Handling

**If Meta was used in Step 3:**
- **Option 1:** Skip Step 5 (Non) and proceed directly to Step 6
- **Option 2:** Use alternative operator for Step 5 (e.g., Para for anomaly detection)
- **Option 3:** Restart HALIRA with different operator sequence

**If stuck in Meta loop:**
- Stop Meta applications immediately
- Proceed to Step 4 (Weave) to integrate
- Don't exceed 2 consecutive Meta applications
