    🌐 **Web Development Workflow Best Practices:**
    
    **Orchestration in Cursor:**
    - **Chat**: Great for bootstrapping changes
    - **Inline Edit** and **Tab**: Help maintain flow state after major pieces are in place
    - Switch between modes to maintain productivity
    
    **Tight Feedback Loops:**
    - Use MCP servers (Linear, Figma, Browser Tools) to reduce context switching
    - Verify implementations in browser using Browser Tools MCP
    - Access designs directly from Figma MCP
    - Pull requirements from Linear MCP
    
    **Component Reuse:**
    - Reuse existing UI components from your component library
    - Create new components by orchestrating existing UI components
    - Ask human when components or designs are missing
    - Maintain consistency with design system
    
    **Task Scoping:**
    - Clear, scoped tasks lead to better results
    - Be intentional with how you prompt
    - Break down complex features into smaller tasks

rule "Declarative Code Patterns" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: file.path contains "frontend" and (block.text contains "React" or block.text contains "JSX" or block.text contains "component")
  message: |
    📝 **Declarative Code Patterns:**
    
    **For React and JSX:**
    - Declarative code works especially well with models
    - Use declarative patterns for UI components
    - Prefer composition over complex logic
    - Keep components focused and reusable
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Models understand declarative patterns better
    - Easier to maintain and reason about
    - Better alignment with design systems
    - More consistent code generation

rule "Design System Integration" {
  type: "guideline"
  when: block.text contains "design system" or block.text contains "component library" or file.path contains "components"
  message: |
    🎨 **Design System Integration:**
    
    **Help the agent discover your design system:**
    - Provide rules that reference your component library path
    - Document component patterns and conventions
    - Use Figma MCP to access design specifications
    - Maintain consistency between design and code
    
    **Component Library Rules:**
    - Reference component library path (e.g., `/src/components/ui`)
    - Document available primitives
    - Specify composition patterns
    - Guide when to create new components
    
    **As Component Library Grows:**
    - Add new rules for new component types
    - Split rules into specific categories when they become too numerous
    - Keep rules focused (e.g., "only apply when working with user inputs")
