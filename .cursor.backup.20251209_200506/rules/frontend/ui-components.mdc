    🧩 **Reuse Existing UI Components:**
    
    **Primary Rule:**
    - Reuse existing UI components from `/src/components/ui` (or your component library path)
    - These are the primitives you can build with
    - Check component library before creating new components
    
    **When Creating New Components:**
    - Create new components by orchestrating existing UI components
    - Compose primitives to build complex components
    - Only create new primitives when existing ones don't solve the problem
    
    **When Components or Designs are Missing:**
    - Ask the human how they want to proceed
    - Don't assume component structure
    - Reference design system via Figma MCP if available
    - Check for similar components in codebase
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Maintain consistency with existing component patterns
    - Follow established naming conventions
    - Use design system tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
    - Verify component matches design using Browser Tools MCP

    🔨 **Component Composition:**
    
    **Composition Strategy:**
    1. Check existing component library first
    2. Look for similar components that can be reused
    3. Compose existing components to build new functionality
    4. Create new primitives only when necessary
    
    **Example Pattern:**
    - Instead of building a complex form from scratch
    - Compose: Input + Button + Label + Validation components
    - Reuse existing form patterns from component library
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Faster development
    - Consistent UI
    - Easier maintenance
    - Better alignment with design system
