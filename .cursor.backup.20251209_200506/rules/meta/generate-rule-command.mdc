    🎯 **Cursor Rule Generator Command**
    
    I'll help you generate a cursor rule following your project's standards.
    
    **Please provide:**
    1. What should the rule enforce? (e.g., "enforce TypeScript strict mode", "require error handling in API routes")
    2. Which category? (backend/frontend/general/workflow/meta)
    3. Should it always apply or be manual? (always/manual/guideline/autoAttached)
    
    **I will:**
    - Generate the rule using the proper template from `.cursor/templates/rules/`
    - Validate it against `.cursor/rules/meta/rule-generator.mdc`
    - Place it in the correct category folder
    - Ensure all required fields are present
    
    **Template Reference:**
    See `.cursor/rules/meta/rule-generation-guide.mdc` for the full template and checklist.
    
    **Example:**
    User: "/generate-rule Create a rule that requires all API routes to have error handling"
    → I'll generate a rule file in `backend/` with proper structure.
}
