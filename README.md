# Λ-Engine (Lambda Engine) - Cursor Rules System

A comprehensive cognitive architecture system for Cursor IDE that uses **Controlled Rupture Operators** to guide AI-assisted development. This system provides adaptive problem-solving through two operational modes and 20 specialized operators.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Type `/` in Cursor chat** to see available commands
2. **Use commands** like `/goal`, `/plan`, `/spec`, `/implement` for common tasks
3. **The system automatically selects** the appropriate mode and operators based on your problem

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Define a goal
/goal define: Build user authentication system

# Create a plan
/plan create: Implement authentication feature

# Generate specification
/spec feature: User authentication with JWT tokens

# Implement the feature
/implement feature: User authentication with JWT
```

## What is the Lambda Engine?

The Lambda Engine is a **cognitive architecture** that operates in two modes:

### Mode 1: Duality Navigation (J=0)
- **For**: Stable, well-defined problems
- **Operators**: A-Constructive (Kata, Telo, Ortho, Pro, Latch)
- **Use when**: You have clear requirements and established patterns

### Mode 2: HALIRA Protocol (J'≠0)
- **For**: Contradictions, paradoxes, or paradigm shifts
- **Operators**: B-Disruptive (Non, Para, Ana, Flux) + HALIRA sequences
- **Use when**: You encounter fundamental contradictions or need paradigm shifts

## Core Concepts

### Phase Space States

The system navigates between three states:

- **J=0 (Sterile Coherence)**: Over-stabilized, avoid over-confidence
- **S* (Productive Contradiction)**: Optimal state with moderate confidence and uncertainty
- **∅ (System Collapse)**: Prevent - complete system failure

### Controlled Rupture Operators

20 operators organized into 4 classes:

1. **A-Constructive** (λ ≈ 0.338): Stabilization and goal-directed work
   - `Telo` (→): Purpose-driven acceleration
   - `Kata` (↓): Compress to concrete
   - `Ortho` (⊥): Correct errors
   - `Pro` (↷): Forward progress
   - `Latch` (🔒): Stabilize solutions

2. **B-Disruptive** (λ ≈ 0.720): Anomaly detection and exploration
   - `Ana` (↑): Elevate to first principles
   - `Para` (∥): Explore alternatives
   - `Non` (¬): Challenge assumptions
   - `Flux` (⚡): Dynamic change

3. **C-Reflexive** (λ ≈ 0.497): Self-reference and backward analysis
   - `Meta` (⟲): Self-reference (max 2 consecutive)
   - `Retro` (↶): Backward analysis
   - `Braid` (🌀): Multi-perspective integration

4. **D-Structural** (λ ≈ 0.464): Integration and structural binding
   - `Weave` (🕸️): Synthesize perspectives
   - `Bind` (🔗): Create cohesion
   - `Axis` (📍): Establish alignment

## Understanding the Rules

### Rule Structure

Rules are located in `.cursor/rules/` and organized by category:

- **`general/`**: Cross-cutting rules (Lambda Engine, operators, modes)
- **`workflow/`**: Process rules (HALIRA Protocol, operator mappings)
- **`meta/`**: Meta rules (date/time references)
- **`backend/`**: Backend-specific rules
- **`frontend/`**: Frontend-specific rules

### Key Rule Files

#### Core Architecture
- `lambda-engine-core-integrated.mdc` - Lambda Engine identity and modes
- `lambda-operators-unified.mdc` - Unified operator framework
- `mode-operator-selection.mdc` - Mode-based operator selection
- `state-detection-enhanced.mdc` - Phase space state detection

#### Workflow
- `halira-protocol-integrated.mdc` - HALIRA Protocol with operator mappings
- `halira-operator-mapping.mdc` - HALIRA step to operator mapping

#### Operators
- `forward-operators-integrated.mdc` - Telo and Ana operators
- `retro-operators-integrated.mdc` - Retro operators
- `operator-tools-integrated.mdc` - Tool selection for operators
- `adversarial-collaboration-integrated.mdc` - Adversarial evaluation

### How Rules Work

1. **Always-Applied Rules**: Some rules (like `mode-operator-selection.mdc`) always apply to guide operator selection
2. **Context-Aware Rules**: Rules activate based on file patterns, keywords, or explicit conditions
3. **Mode-Aware Rules**: Rules adapt based on current Lambda Engine mode (Mode 1 or Mode 2)

## Common Workflows

## Operator Sequences

### Common Sequences for Mode 1

- **Stabilization**: `Kata ∘ Weave ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.32)
- **Goal Achievement**: `Telo ∘ Pro ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.35)
- **Error Correction**: `Ortho ∘ Kata ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.31)

### Common Sequences for Mode 2

- **Complete HALIRA**: `Seed ∘ Axis ∘ Meta ∘ Weave ∘ Non ∘ Para ∘ Ortho ∘ Bind` (λ_eff ≈ 0.52)
- **Paradigm Shift**: `Para ∘ Ana ∘ Seed` (λ_eff ≈ 0.56)
- **Anomaly Detection**: `Meta ∘ Non` (λ_eff ≈ 0.85) ⚠️ Never Non after Meta

## Tips and Best Practices

### Command Usage

1. **Chain Commands**: Commands can be chained for complex workflows
   ```bash
   /goal define: X
   /plan create: Y
   /spec feature: Z
   ```

2. **Use Explicit Parameters**: For clarity, use explicit parameter syntax
   ```bash
   /spec feature: User authentication
   /api resource: users
   /data model: User
   ```

3. **Check State**: Use `/detect-state` to understand current reasoning state

4. **Analyze Dissipation**: Use `/dissipate` to optimize operator sequences

### Mode Selection

- **Default to Mode 1** for routine tasks and stable problems
- **Escalate to Mode 2** when:
  - Foundational contradictions detected
  - Irreducible paradoxes encountered
  - Current paradigm insufficient
  - Requires paradigm shift

### Operator Constraints

- **Meta Operator**: Maximum 2 consecutive applications
- **Non after Meta**: **FORBIDDEN** - Never apply Non after Meta (causes collapse)
- **Vale Operator**: Use with extreme caution (high collapse risk, λ=0.88)

## Adversarial Collaboration

The system operates in **adversarial collaboration mode**:

- **Evaluates prompts** as formal operators
- **Stress-tests designs** and architectures
- **Challenges assumptions** and finds edge cases
- **Suggests improvements** rather than just executing

Use `/eval` to evaluate designs, prompts, or requests:

```bash
/eval design: Microservices architecture
/eval prompt: Add caching to all endpoints
/eval request: Implement feature X
```

2. **Check `.cursor/COMMANDS.md`** for detailed command documentation
3. **Use `/detect-state`** to understand current reasoning state

```bash
/detect-state analyze: Need both consistency and scalability but they conflict
